# Firebase Configuration Fix

## Issue: Unauthorized Domain Error

The console shows `auth/unauthorized-domain` error because your development domain (`localhost:8081` and `192.168.0.13:8081`) are not authorized in Firebase.

## Quick Fix:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `profithive-f5410`
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Click "Authentication" in left sidebar
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Authorized domains" section

4. **Add these domains**:
   ```
   localhost
   192.168.0.13
   ```

5. **Save changes**

## Alternative: Use Email Authentication Only

If you don't need Google Sign-In in development, you can disable the Google button by modifying the LoginModal component.

## Current Status:
- ✅ Error logging has been cleaned up
- ✅ User-friendly error message added
- ✅ Console spam reduced
- ⏳ Firebase domain authorization needed (manual step above)

Once you add the authorized domains, Google Sign-In will work perfectly!
